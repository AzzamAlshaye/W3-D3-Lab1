            My name is Azzam Alshaye. I'm originally from Al Mithnab, a
            beautiful town located in the Al-Qassim Region of Saudi Arabia.
            Although my roots are in Al Mithnab, I was raised in Riyadh, the
            capital city where I have spent my entire life. Growing up in Riyadh
            gave me many opportunities to experience city life, education, and
            modern culture, while still maintaining a strong connection to my
            hometown. During vacations and holidays, I always make it a point to
            return to Al Mithnab, where I reconnect with my family, traditions,
            and the quieter lifestyle.

          </h5>
          <p>
            I successfully earned my Bachelor's degree in Information Systems
            from Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University, where I studied from
            2019 to 2024. Throughout my academic journey, I engaged deeply with
            both theoretical and practical aspects of computing, technology, and
            information management. The curriculum provided me with a strong
            foundation in a wide range of technical subjects, allowing me to
            develop and sharpen my programming and analytical skills. During my
            time at the university, I acquired proficiency in several key
            programming and development tools, including HTML for front-end web
            development, SQL for data querying and database design, and Java for
            object-oriented programming and application logic. I also became
            skilled in Dart and Flutter, which I used to build cross-platform
            mobile applications with responsive and user-friendly interfaces.
            Additionally, I worked extensively with Firebase, enhancing my
            knowledge in real-time databases, authentication services, and
            cloud-based app functionality. Beyond programming languages and
            frameworks, I gained valuable hands-on experience working with
            Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, understanding their role
            in integrating various business processes and enhancing
            organizational efficiency. I explored the Oracle Database platform
            in depth, learning how to manage data securely, execute complex
            queries, and optimize system performance.
